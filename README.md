# GOTHAM Chemical Network

The chemical network is based on kida.uva.2014 ([Wakelam _et al._ 2015](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/217/2/20)) with targeted modifications to support interstellar detections reported by the GOTHAM collaboration.

A total of nine files are provided, which are the input files for the astrochemical model [`Nautilus`](https://forge.oasu.u-bordeaux.fr/LAB/astrochem-tools/pnautilus)

For details about the methodology, particularly with respect to [`Nautilus`](https://forge.oasu.u-bordeaux.fr/LAB/astrochem-tools/pnautilus), please refer to [Ruaud _et al._ 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw887)
